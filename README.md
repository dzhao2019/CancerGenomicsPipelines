# CancerGenomicsPipelines

A public repository for documenting bioinformatics pipeline development in cancer genomics.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of my experiments, code, and notes related to building 
and managing bioinformatics pipelines for cancer genomics research. It documents my journey in:

* Developing and optimizing bioinformatics workflows. 
* Improving project management skills for computational biology. 
* Exploring tools and technologies for pipeline development.

**_Important Note:_** 

This is a **public** repository. 
This repository is **not intended as an educational resource for others**. 
Content reflects my learning process and may include incomplete or evolving code.

## OUTLINE

This repository is organized around the following key areas:

* **Pipeline Development:** Design, implementation, and optimization of bioinformatics pipelines.
* **Tool Exploration:** Investigation and usage of relevant bioinformatics tools and technologies.
* **Project Management:** Strategies for organizing and managing bioinformatics projects.

## Content Guidelines

To maintain clarity and focus, the following guidelines are used:

* **Workflow Focus:** Emphasize pipeline construction, modification, and execution.
* **Tool Usage in Context:** Document how tools are used *within* pipelines (parameters, inputs/outputs).
* **Code and Scripts:** Include code snippets and pipeline scripts with explanations.
* **Reproducibility:** Note strategies for ensuring reproducibility (e.g., version control, containerization).
* **Exclude SOPs:** Do not include detailed, step-by-step Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
